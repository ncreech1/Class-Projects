In case Topcoder's servers are down, here is a summary of the problem:

<UL>
<LI> You are given a vector of integers, <b>arr</b>.
<LI> The integers are distinct, positive, and in increasing order.
<LI> The topcoder constraints have the size of <b>arr</b> being between 1 and 50, but you can 
     solve this for array sizes up to 1,000,000.
<LI> For any two integers <i>a &le; b</i>, the "range <i>[a,b]</i>" 
      is composed of all integers <i>i</i> such that <i>a &le; i &le; b</i>.
<LI> If you view <b>arr</b> as a union of ranges, what is the smallest number of
     ranges that are required, so that their union is <b>arr</b>.

Examples (these are compiled into the <b>main.cpp</b> program):

<td align=center>Example</td>
<td align=center>Input</td>
<td align=center>Output</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>0</td>
<td align=center>{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 }</td>
<td align=center>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>1</td>
<td align=center>{ 1, 6, 10, 20, 32, 49 }</td>
<td align=center>6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>2</td>
<td align=center>{ 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15 }</td>
<td align=center>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>3</td>
<td align=center>{ 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47 }</td>
<td align=center>14</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>4</td>
<td align=center>{ 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 }</td>
<td align=center>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>5</td>
<td align=center>{ 33 }</td>
<td align=center>1</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

I have also made it so that if you give the test program a number between 6 and 1,000,000, then
it generates a random problem with that many elements in <b>arr</b>.
<p>
If you compile your program to <b>a.out</b>, then running 
<b><a href=tests.sh>tests.sh</a></b>
should
yield the exact same answer as 
<b><a href=answers.txt>answers.txt</a></b>.  The whole thing should take under a half of
a second.

<H3>Hints (or, in this case, not really)</h3>

As the numbers above show, this was one of the easiest Topcoder problems ever.  
I'm not going to give code here -- this is for you to figure out.  My one hint is that my 
for loop was:

<pre>
  for (i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++) ...
</pre>
