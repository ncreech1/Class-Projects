Here is a summary of the problem:

<UL>
<LI> You are given two strings, <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>, composed of lower and uppercase letters.
<LI> The "difference" between 
<b>a</b> and <b>b</b> with respect to a letter <b>c</b> is:
<p>
<center>
<i> (number_of_occurences_of_<b>c</b>_in_<b>a</b> -
     number_of_occurences_of_<b>c</b>_in_<b>b</b>)<sup>2</sup></i>
</center>
<p>
<LI> You ignore case in this problem -- in other words, you treat upper and lower case
versions of a letter identically.
<LI> You are given a third string, <b>letterSet</b>.
<LI> Calculate and return the sum of 
     the differences betwen <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> with respect to all of the letters
     in <b>letterSet</b>.
<LI> All strings are between 1 and 50 characters long.

<h3>Testing yourself</h3>

I have a shell script 
<b><a href=tests.sh>tests.sh</a></b>
, that you can use to test your program.  When you
run <b>tests.sh</b>, your answer should be identical to
<b><a href=answers.txt>answers.txt</a></b>.

<hr>
<h3>Hints</h3>


First, read the problem description and make sure
that you understand what it's asking.  Go through each example, and make sure that you 
know why each answer is correct.  With example 4, use math rather than 
counting digits:
<p>
The answer is 5000, and the first string is all a's, while the second string is all b's.
And the strings are the same size.  So, let that size be <i>s</i>.  You know that the
distance between the two strings with respect to the character 'a' is <i>s<sup>2</sup></i>.
And the
distance between the two strings with respect to the character 'b' is also 
<i>s<sup>2</sup></i>.  So, you need to find an <i>s</i> such that 
<i>2s<sup>2</sup></i> equals 5000.   That means <i>s<sup>2</sup></i> equals 2500.   
So <i>s</i> is 50: the first string is 50 a's, and the second is 50 b's.  Excellent.
<hr>
Now, let's start programming a solution.  Your first job is to set up the <b>DistanceBetweenStrings</b> class, which has a public method called <b>getDistance()</b>.  <b>getDistance()</b>
should take three strings as parameters, and return an integer.  
<p>
Now, implement <b>getDistance()</b> so that it simply returns zero.  Get that to compile
in the Topcoder app and test it.  You'll see that it gives the right answer for examples 1
and 5.  Ha ha.  
<hr>
Now, update your program so that it goes through <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> and converts upper
case to lower case.  Have it print out <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>, but still have it return 0.
It won't be correct, but you can now test whether you did it correctly by looking at the
output, especially for examples 3 and 5.  Remember from class -- you can test whether a
character is uppercase by testing it against the characters 'A' and 'Z'.  Then you can 
convert uppercase to lowercase by subtracting 'A' and adding 'a'.
<hr>
Now, go through every character in <b>letterSet</b>, and
count the occurrences of that character in <b>a</b> and in <b>b</b>.
Print that out.  You should still return 0 -- you just want to make sure you have 
your code running correctly.  Here it is on all of the examples:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3>
<td align=center valign=top><u>Example 0</u><pre>
t 1 2
c 1 1
p 1 0
</pre></td>
<td align=center valign=top><u>Example 1</u><pre>
f 1 1
e 1 1
d 1 1
</pre></td>
<td align=center valign=top><u>Example 2</u><pre>
a 5 0
</pre></td>
<td align=center valign=top><u>Example 3</u><pre>
a 4 3
b 1 2
</pre></td>
<td align=center valign=top><u>Example 4</u><pre>
b 0 50
a 50 0
</pre></td>
<td align=center valign=top><u>Example 5</u><pre>
w 0 0
x 0 0
y 0 0
z 0 0
</pre></td>
</table></center><p>
<hr>
Now finish your program by calculating the distances and returning the total.
