Please use the workflow in the problem <a href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~plank/topcoder-writeups/2010/Cryptography/index.html>Cryptography</a>.
<p>

Here is a summary of the problem:

<UL>
<LI> You are given a string that represents a positive integer.
<LI> The integer can be huge.  The topcoder constraints say up to 50 digits, but my testing
     program goes up to roughly  9,600 digits.  Clearly, you can't store them in a <b>long long</b>.
<LI> The string only contains the characters from '0' to '9', and it does not start with a zero.
<LI> You are allowed to swap any two digits, although you don't have to if you don't want to.
<LI> Your goal is to produce the smallest possible integer after swapping those two digits (or
     not swapping, if that yields the smallest integer).
<LI> That integer may not start with '0'.
<LI> Return the string containing that integer.
</UL>

I am going to present three ways to solve this problem -- one is very easy to write, and will
run easily within Topcoder's time limits (but not with <b>tests.sh</b>).
The other two require more thought, but end up with 
programs that are better.  Go ahead and program up the easy one and submit/test it.
Then, try one of the other ways.  It's good programming and thought practice.
You should be able to analyze all of them to determine that the second
and third ways are better than the first.

<h3>The Easy and Inefficient Way</h3>

If you represent two numbers as strings with the same number of characters,
then comparing the strings is equivalent to comparing the numbers.  So, the
easiest thing to do is to try all combinations of <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>, swapping
their digits, and returning the smallest number, while discarding numbers that begin with
zero.
<p>
Enumerating all combinations of <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> takes roughly <i>n<sup>2</sup></i>
operations, so this is not a good way to solve the problem in general.  However, the topcoder
constraints limit the string to 50 characters, and 50*50 is a pretty small number, so it
works easily.
<p>
In <b>tests.sh</b>, you can do the first 58 problems in under a second.  The 59th, and last
problem is roughly 9600 characters, and took my program roughly 9 seconds to do.  You can 
test your solution on the first 58 problems with:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>head -n 58 tests.sh | sh</b></font>
</pre>

<hr>
<h3>The Harder and Efficient Way</h3>

To solve this problem more efficiently, think about conditions when you swap digits.
In particular:

<UL>
<LI> Under what conditions would you swap the first digit?
<LI> If you don't swap the first digit, then under what conditions would you swap
the second digit?
<LI> If you don't swap the second digit, how do you find the leftmost digit to swap?
</UL>

If you're still stuck, I'll answer those questions:

<UL>
<LI> If the first digit is greater than any other non-zero digit, then you are going
to swap the first digit.  Consider example 2: "5491727514".  If you don't swap that
initial 5, you'll end up with a number in the form "5xxxxxxxxx".  If you swap the 5 and
the 4, you'll end up with "4591727514".  Clearly that number is smaller than any number
that begins with 5.  That means you have to swap the five.
<p>
What are you going to swap it with?  Well, you want to maximize
the effect of replacing the first digit, so you should swap it with the smallest digit
that's not zero (because we are not allowed to start the number with a zero).
What if there are multiple of these?  Again, let's look at example 2: "5491727514".  We
want to swap the '5' with a '1' and there are two '1' digits.  The two potential 
swaps yield "1495727514" and "1491727554".  The second of these is smaller -- we want
to swap with the rightmost '1'.
<p>
Of course, that was just proof-by-Cosmo.  Can you prove to yourself that you want the
rightmost, minimum non-zero digit?  It is correct.
<p>
As a second example, look at example 4: "93218910471211292416".  
'9' is definitely bigger than some digits to its right, so you are going
to swap it.  There are a bunch of ones, so you will swap it with a one, because that is the
smallest non-zero digit.  Which '1'?  The rightmost one.  That's how you get the
answer "13218910471211292496".
<p>
<LI> Now, if you don't swap the first digit, then you want to swap the second digit.  We don't
care about leading zeros now, so if the second digit is greater than <i>any</i> digit to its
right, we will be swapping the second digit.  With what do we swap it?  With the rightmost,
smallest digit.
<p>
<LI> If we don't swap the second digit, that's because it is less than or equal to all 
digits to the right.  Now, you need to find the leftmost digit that is greater than any digit
to its right.  Swap that one with the rightmost smallest digit.
</UL>
<p>
This gives us a strategy for solving the problem, but if we program it in the most
natural way, the program still runs in <i>n<sup>2</sup></i> operations.  The most "natural"
way is to work from the definition: start <i>i</i> at zero and have it go to the end of
the string.  For each value of <i>i</i>, you look at each value to the right of <i>i</i> 
and find the minimum, rightmost value (when <i>i</i> equals zero, you exclude zero).  If 
this value is less than the digit in <i>i</i>, then you swap those digits and return.  If
the value is greater than or equal to the digit in <i>i</i>, then you increment <i>i</i>
and try again.
<p>
If you think about it, when your input is a non-decreasing sequence of digits, this technique
still uses <i>n<sup>2</sup></i> operations.  Why?  Because at iteration <i>i</i>, you look 
at all of the digits greater than <i>i</i>, and there are <i>n-i</i> of those (where the
number has <i>n</i> digits).
<p>
How can we fix this?  By thinking clearly and organizing our code so that we are not
doing unnecessary, nested <b>for</b> loops.  
Interestingly, I solved it in one way, and Allen solved it
another.  I'll describe both.  Allen's solution is better.
<hr>
<h3>The Plank Solution</h3>

The Plank solution relies on the fact that there are only ten digits in our number.
So, let's keep a vector <b>V</b>
with ten elements.  <b>V[i]</b> holds the rightmost index of digit '<i>i</i>' in the
string.  If digit '<i>i</i>' doesn't occur, then element <i>i</i> is -1.  In example 1, 
where the string is "93561", the vector is 
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3>
<tr>
<td align=center><i>i</i></td>
<td align=center>0</td>
<td align=center>1</td>
<td align=center>2</td>
<td align=center>3</td>
<td align=center>4</td>
<td align=center>5</td>
<td align=center>6</td>
<td align=center>7</td>
<td align=center>8</td>
<td align=center>9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center><b>v[i]</b></td>
<td align=center>-1</td>
<td align=center>4</td>
<td align=center>-1</td>
<td align=center>1</td>
<td align=center>-1</td>
<td align=center>2</td>
<td align=center>3</td>
<td align=center>-1</td>
<td align=center>-1</td>
<td align=center>0</td>
</tr>
</table></center><p>
Now, you run through the string as before, but finding the minimum value to the right of digit <i>i</i> simply requires you to run through the vector, whose size is limited to ten elements.  Instead of requiring <i>n<sup>2</sup></i> operations in the worst case, it is linear!  
<p>
When I ran <b>tests.sh</b> on this solution, the entire thing ran in 0.16 seconds.

<h3>The McBride Solution</h3>

In this solution, you work from the end of the string to the beginning of the string, and
you maintain three variables: 
<UL>
<LI> <b>min_digit</b> is the minimum digit that you've seen so far.  Start it at '0'+10 at
the beginning of the loop (this is an impossible value, but since it is greater than every digit,
it works nicely in the loop.  This is called a "sentinel", by the way).
<LI> <b>min_nonzero</b> is the minimum non-zero that you've seen so far.  Also start it at '0'+10 at
the beginning of the loop.
<LI> <b>lpos</b> is the index of the leftmost digit that is greater than either 
<b>min_digit</b> or 
<b>min_nonzero</b>.  If <b>lpos = 0</b> it must be greater than <b>min_nonzero</b>.  Otherwise,
it must be greater than <b>min_digit</b>.  If there is no value of <b>lpos</b> that works, it
should be -1.
</UL>
<p>

Let's give an example that is similar to example 3: "10423".  You should be able to see that
the answer will be "10243".  Here are the variables as you run through the string from right to
left:
<p><center><table border=3>
<tr><td align=center><b>i</b></td>
    <td align=center><b>min_digit</b></td>
    <td align=center><b>min_nonzero</b></td>
    <td align=center><b>lpos</b></td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>Start</td>
    <td align=center>'0'+10</td>
    <td align=center>'0'+10</td>
    <td align=center>-1</td><tr>
<tr><td align=center>4</td>
    <td align=center>'3'</td>
    <td align=center>'3'</td>
    <td align=center>-1</td><tr>
<tr><td align=center>3</td>
    <td align=center>'2'</td>
    <td align=center>'2'</td>
    <td align=center>-1</td><tr>
<tr><td align=center>2</td>
    <td align=center>'2'</td>
    <td align=center>'2'</td>
    <td align=center>2</td><tr>
<tr><td align=center>1</td>
    <td align=center>'0'</td>
    <td align=center>'2'</td>
    <td align=center>2</td><tr>
<tr><td align=center>0</td>
    <td align=center>'0'</td>
    <td align=center>'1'</td>
    <td align=center>2</td><tr>
</table></center><p>

In that last iteration, we don't set <b>lpos</b> equal to zero because the digit must be
less then <b>min_nonzero</b> when <b>lpos</b> equals zero.
<p>
Now, when you're done, you are going to swap the digit at index <b>lpos</b>.  Obviously, if 
<b>lpos</b> equals -1, you simply return the original string.   If <b>lpos</b> equals zero, you 
want to find the rightmost minimum, non-zero digit, and swap with that.  Otherwise,
you want to find the rightmost, minimum digit that is to the right of <b>lpos</b>, and swap
with that.  In the example above, we start at index 2 (whose digit is '4'), 
and find the rightmost, minimum digit
to the right of it -- that's the '2', which is at index 3.  Swap the '2' and the '4', and you 
have your answer.
<p>
Think about the running time.  The first loop runs through the string once.  And the second
loop (finding the rightmost occurence of the digit to swap with <b>lpos</b>) also runs through 
the string once.  That's two traversals of the string -- it's linear, and it doesn't rely on 
the number of digits being limited to 10, like the Plank solution.  Very nice, Allen!
<p>
When I programmed this up, it also ran <b>tests.sh</b> in 0.16 seconds.
