<h3>In case Topcoder's servers are down</h3>

Here is a summary of the problem:

<UL>
<LI> You are given two vectors of string, <b>speech</b> and <b>words</b>.
<LI> All strings are composed solely of lower case letters.
<LI> Although the topcoder constraints say that each vector is limited to 
     50 strings in size, I am increasing those constraints to 10000.
<LI> The strings in <b>words</b> are unique.
<LI> Return the number of strings in <b>speech</b> that are also in <b>words</b>.
</UL>

<h3>The examples</h3>

<UL>
<LI> <b>Example 0</b>:<br>
<pre>
speech = {"make", "topcoder", "great", "again"}
words  = {"make", "america", "great", "again"}
return value: 3
</pre>
<p>
<LI> <b>Example 1</b>:<br>
<pre>
speech = {"toads"}
words  = {"toad"}
return value: 0
</pre>
<p>
<LI> <b>Example 2</b>:<br>
<pre>
speech = {"a", "a"}
words = {"a"}
return value: 2
</pre>
<p>
<LI> <b>Example 3</b>:<br>
<pre>
speech = {"je", "le", "ai", "deja", "vu", "et", "je", "le", "veux", "encore"}
words  = {"i", "am", "having", "deja", "vu", "please", "stop", "the", "encore"}
return value: 3
</pre>
<p>

<h3>Testing yourself</h3>

Like the <a href=../../2010/Cryptography/index.html>Cryptography Problem</a>,
I have a shell script <b>tests.sh</b>, that you can use to test your program.  When you
run <b>tests.sh</b>, your answer should be identical to
<b><a href=answers.txt>answers.txt</a></b>, and the running time should be well less than
a second, total.

<h3>Hints</h3>
With the topcoder constraints being so low, a simply double-nested <b>for</b> loop will work.
However, being the good computer scientist that you, dear reader, are, (and given the 
fact that my testing script increases those constraints), you will naturally
take offense at writing an <i>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</i> solution to this problem.
<p>
Instead, insert the words in <b>words</b> into a set, and then for each word in 
<b>speech()</b>, try to find it in the set.  
Now your solution is <i>O(n log n)</i>, and all is right with the
universe.
