<h3>In case Topcoder's servers are down</h3>

Here is a summary of the problem:

<UL>
<LI> You are playing a video game which works in discrete 1-second time steps.
<LI> At the start of the game, you are at the point (0,0), and there is a collection 
     of fruit at various <i>(x,y)</i> points above you.  
<LI> The fruit is given to you in two vectors <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>, which are the same
     size.  Fruit <i>i</i> starting location is in <i><b>(x[i], y[i])</b></i>.
<LI> At each time step, the fruit will move one point lower --
     <i>(x,y)</i>  becomes
     <i>(x,y-1)</i>.
<LI> You may only move horizontally, one unit per time step.  In other words, you
    <i>(x,0)</i> may become
    <i>(x-1,0)</i>,
    <i>(x,0)</i> or
    <i>(x+1,0)</i>.
<LI> You can "catch" fruit if you are at the fruit's <i>x</i> position when the fruit's
     <i>y</i> position becomes zero.
<LI> Your goal is to catch all of the fruit.  If you can do this, return the string "Able to catch".
     If you cannot, return the string "Not able to catch".
<LI> Although the topcoder constraints limit you to 50 fruit, I'm bumping that up to 10,000.
<LI> The fruits' <i>x</i> locations will be between -1,000,000 and 1,000,000.
<LI> The fruits' <i>y</i> locations will be between 0 and 100,000.

<h3>Testing yourself</h3>

Like the <a href=../../2010/Cryptography/index.html>Cryptography Problem</a>,
I have a shell script <b>tests.sh</b>, that you can use to test your program.  When you
run <b>tests.sh</b>, your answer should be identical to
<b><a href=answers.txt>answers.txt</a></b>, and the running time should be less than
a second, total (mine was 0.67 seconds).

<h3>Hints</h3>

This problem is all about using the right data structure for the job, and I can only 
imagine that the high number of incorrect answers comes from the fact that the programmers
were not comfortable with multimaps.  At least, that's my best guess.  So, this will be
a good problem for you if you are learning maps/multimaps.
<p>
Suppose you are
at the starting point.  Which candy do you have to get next?  It has to be the lowest
one.  So you move to the <i>x</i> value of the lowest one, if you can.  At that point,
you care about the next lowest one, and so on.
<p>
Let's walk example 0. The candies are at (-1,1), (1,3) and (0,4).
So:
<UL>
<LI> You start at (0,0).  You care about the lowest candy, which is (-1,1).
<LI> Your <i>x</i> distance to the candy is 1, as is the <i>y</i> distance.  That means that
you can move to <i>x=-1</i> in time to get the candy.
<LI> You are now at (-1,1).  You care about the next lowest candy, which is (1,3).
<LI> Your <i>x</i> distance to the candy is 2, and the <i>y</i> distance is also 2.  
That means that you can move to <i>x=1</i> in time to get the candy.
<LI> You are now at (1,3).  You care about the next lowest candy, which is (0,4).
<LI> Your <i>x</i> distance to the candy is 1, and the <i>y</i> distance is also 1.  
That means that you can move to <i>x=0</i> in time to get the candy.
<LI> You're done, so you can return "Able to catch."
</ul>

Solving the problem works exactly in this manner.  You first need to arrange the candies
in increasing order of <i>y</i> values.  To do this, insert the points into a multimap.
Why a multimap?  Because there may points with duplicate <i>y</i> values.  When you insert
a point, make the <i>y</i> value the <b>first</b> part of the entry, make the
<i>x</i> value the <b>second</b> part.  

<p>
Now, simulate the game.  Let's call your current <i>x</i> value <i>cx</i>, and your
current <i>y</i> value <i>cy</i>.  You'll start with both of these equal to zero.
<p>
Now, you traverse the multimap.  Calculate 
your <i>x</i> distance from the point in the multimap to <i>cx</i> and 
your <i>y</i> distance from the point in the multimap to <i>cy</i>.  If the <i>x</i> distance
is greater than the <i>y</i> distance, then you're done -- you are "Not able to catch."
Otherwise, update <i>cx</i> and <i>cy</i>, and continue.  If you reach the end of the 
multimap, you can return "Able to catch."

Here's a picture of example 4, which shows all of the points that make the
answer "Not able to catch."
